# Modifiable-Priority
### Generic Modifiable Priority written in C++
The actual priority queue in C++ is not modifiable, so changing the priority of an object in priority queue
is impossible. However you can make your own manual priority queue but it can lead to an unwanted
complexity, this standalone generic modifiable priority built of std::map and std::set will bring O(logn)
modifiable priority queue that is simple, and easy to use.

Fast Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm is a real world algorithm that needs Modifiable-Priority.
### Usage

If you are familiar with generic types in C++ you can use this type as easy as the
std::priority_queue. Check basic_examples.cpp for more informations
